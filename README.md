- 👋 Hi, I’m @hillary-aa
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge of coding and web development. I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a little SQL. I would like to learn PHP, C++, and Ruby. Recommendations for free online courses would be appreciated! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about how to use the server to find and correct errors on my own without assistance.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, but that could change. 
- 📫 How to reach me: h.l.alexander9@gmail.com
